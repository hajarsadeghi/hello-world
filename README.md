# hello-world
to start
So I guess I'm following the github guide to create a new repository!
Since I only have access to public repository I guess if anyone's interested they will definately se my Hello-world repository but I should mention that I am an experienced front-end developer but I haven't done any work on my github accound :/ 
So anyway I decided to follow what github suggets to get more comfortable around github! I hope I get a lot of green squares soon :)
