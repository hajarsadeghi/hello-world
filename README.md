# hello-world
So I guess I'm following the github's guide to create a new repository!
Since I only have access to the public repository, I guess if anyone's interested they will definately see my Hello-world repository. I also should mention that I am an experienced front-end developer but I haven't done any work on my github accound :/ 
So anyway, I decided to follow what github suggets to get more comfortable around github! I hope I get a lot of green squares soon :)
